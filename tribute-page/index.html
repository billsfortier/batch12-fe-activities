                    <p>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was born on Friday, May 29, 1970, in Manhattan, New York City, to Howard and Maria Stark. 
                        Stark had become good friends with Edwin Jarvis, the butler of the Stark family, who watched over him throughout all 
                        of his childhood. Stark's early life was often dominated by the absence of his father, who he would later describe 
                        as both 'cold' and 'calculating'. Growing up, Stark had issues with Howard, who never told his son that he loved, or 
                        even liked him. Since Stark was so young, Howard could not tell his son his plans for him. Howard constantly talked 
                        about his admiration for Captain America, which caused Stark to develop hatred and resentment towards the super 
                        soldier. However, Stark had a loving relationship with his mother, who was more gentle and nurturing; he enjoyed 
                        hearing Maria play the piano.

                    <h1>STORY</h1><br><br>
                    <p>
                        Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of 
                        Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. 
                        With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of
                        his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while
                        demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his 
                        captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned 
                        against Stark. Stark enjoyed the fame that came with his new secret identity and decided to share it with the world, publicly 
                        revealing himself as Iron Man.

                        Fresh off from defeating enemies all over the world, Stark found himself dying due to his own Arc Reactor poisoning his body, all 
                        while he was challenged by Ivan Vanko who attempted to destroy his legacy. After the Stark Expo Incident, Stark reluctantly agreed 
                        to serve as a consultant for S.H.I.E.L.D. where he used his position to upgrade their technology while he began a relationship with 
                        Pepper Potts. With the world yet again being threatened, Stark joined the Avengers and helped defeat the Chitauri and Loki. Due to 
                        the battle, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, leading him to create the Iron Legion to safeguard the world and help
                         him retire.

                        The 2012 "Mandarin" terrorist attacks forced Stark to come out of retirement to protect his country, inadvertently putting his loved
                         ones at risk and leaving him defenseless when his home was destroyed. Stark continued his mission, finding Aldrich Killian as the 
                         mastermind of the attacks. Eventually, Stark defeated Killian, and was prompted to destroy all of his armors with the Clean Slate 
                         Protocol after almost losing Potts. However, when the Avengers were officially demobilized due to the War on HYDRA, Stark built more
                          armors and resumed his role as Iron Man, aiding them in the capture of Wolfgang von Strucker and acquiring Loki's Scepter.

                        Once the threat of HYDRA had been ended, at last, Stark, influenced by Wanda Maximoff's mind games, built Ultron with the help of Bruce
                         Banner as a new peacekeeping A.I. to protect the world and allow the Avengers to retire. However, Ultron believed that humanity threatened
                          the world and thus, according to his program, decided to extinguish humanity. Through the work of the Avengers, Ultron was defeated, however,
                           not without massive civilian cost and many lives being lost during which Sokovia was elevated into the sky.

                        After the Ultron Offensive, Stark retired from active duty, still haunted by his role in the chaos the A.I. created. The guilt of creating 
                        Ultron and causing so much destruction and loss of life eventually convinced Stark to support the Sokovia Accords. Stark was forced to lead
                         a manhunt for his ally Captain America when the latter began protecting the fugitive Winter Soldier, igniting the Avengers Civil War. The 
                         end result left the Avengers in complete disarray, especially after Stark learned of the Winter Soldier's role in his parents' deaths. 
                         Afterwards, Stark returned to New York to mentor and guide Spider-Man into becoming a better hero than he ever was, also becoming engaged 
                         with Potts in the process.

                        When Thanos and the Black Order invaded Earth in their conquest to acquire the six Infinity Stones, Stark, Doctor Strange, and Spider-Man 
                        convened to battle Thanos on Titan with the help of the Guardians of the Galaxy. When Stark was held at Thanos' mercy, Doctor Strange 
                        surrendered the Time Stone for Stark's life. After the Snap, Stark and Nebula remained the sole survivors on Titan. Stark and Nebula used 
                        the Benatar to escape Titan, but were stranded in space as the ship was damaged. They were rescued by Captain Marvel, who brought them back 
                        to Earth.

                        Five years after the Snap, Stark chose to retire from being Iron Man, marrying Potts and having a daughter, Morgan. When Stark devised a method
                         to safely travel through time and space, he rejoined the Avengers in their mission to acquire the six Infinity Stones from the past in order 
                         to resurrect those killed by the Snap, and traveled back in time to retrieve the Scepter and regain the Tesseract. During the Battle of Earth,
                          Stark sacrificed himself to eliminate an alternate version of Thanos and his army, who traveled through time to collect their Infinity Stones, 
                          saving the universe from decimation and leaving behind a legacy as one of Earth's most revered superheroes.
